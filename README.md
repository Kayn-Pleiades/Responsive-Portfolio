### Commit 2: Initial Commit. Adding Base files
Oops, forgot that the making is auto named the inital commit.
I created an assits folder and the files for my different webpages

### Commit 3: started adding skeleton to index page
Put in the basic parts of an html page. Because this is my first time using Bootstrap, I took their sample navbar on their componant page and pasted it in so that I can play with it and find out what each aspect does in a hands on fashion. 

## Commit 4: navbar on index
Started my README and my recording of my process and the steps I'm taking. 
Got my navbar working how I want it too.
Made html skeleton for the other pages.
