## description 

This time I made a homepage for myself! I took care to make sure it was something that I could not only feel proud of, but that also shows my personalitly. 

Here are some images!

## process

### Commit 1: Initial commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Initial Commit. Adding Base files
Oops, forgot that the making is auto named the inital commit.
I created an assits folder and the files for my different webpages

### Commit 3: started adding skeleton to index page
Put in the basic parts of an html page. Because this is my first time using Bootstrap, I took their sample navbar on their componant page and pasted it in so that I can play with it and find out what each aspect does in a hands on fashion. 

### Commit 4: navbar on index
Started my README and my recording of my process and the steps I'm taking. 
Got my navbar working how I want it too.
Made html skeleton for the other pages.

### Commit 5: added container
I added the container, but still a bit unsure about how to use it. Will play around with it.

### Commit 6: Added main and footer 
I moved the container and played around with columns for a bit.
After being told by my instructor that it didn't need to look like the example, only function the same, I decided I want my box to chill in the center of the page. Having it to the side like the example makes me want to add a transparent picture down in the right corner, as that was the format of many of my tumblr layouts. It's fun, but this is for a portfolio. Nice and centered just feels like the way to go.
After much research on the bootstrap site, I also figured out how to add a sticky footer! 

### Commit 7: Index Layout finished
I finished the basic layout for the index page and added some personal touches such as colors, rounding the image, and a background.

### Commit 8: More Aesthetic Changes
I started by continuing my customization. I want my basic page template finished so I can apply it to the other pages.
With this being a reflection of me, I knew I wanted scallop borders. At first I tried using a background image on the header and footer elements, but I wasn't satisfied with the result. So instead, I researched how to make scallops with CSS!

### Commit 9: Other Pages Implimented 
Started work on the other pages!
Put in all the links and then put in the content of the other pages. The last required thing to do is write my bio.
I will also add a few more photos, but I have to get them off my older, dying laptop, so I'll get back to that later.

### Commit 10: Finishing Up
Wrote my about and added a social media link. Going to finish up my documentation, and then submit!

### Commit 11: Fixed Readme
Having trouble getting the screenshots to work, so hopefully this fixes them!

### Commit 12: Updates
Made updates to existing pages, started the process of my new resume page. 

### Commit 13: Resume Format
Going with a collapable format so all the information is neat and tidy

### Commit 14: Contact Info
Added my contact info as a table

### Commit 15: Skills
Added my skills
