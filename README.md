## process

### Commit 1: Initial commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Initial Commit. Adding Base files
Oops, forgot that the making is auto named the inital commit.
I created an assits folder and the files for my different webpages

### Commit 3: started adding skeleton to index page
Put in the basic parts of an html page. Because this is my first time using Bootstrap, I took their sample navbar on their componant page and pasted it in so that I can play with it and find out what each aspect does in a hands on fashion. 

### Commit 4: navbar on index
Started my README and my recording of my process and the steps I'm taking. 
Got my navbar working how I want it too.
Made html skeleton for the other pages.

### Commit 5: added container
I added the container, but still a bit unsure about how to use it. Will play around with it.

### Commit 6: Added main and footer 
I moved the container and played around with columns for a bit.
After being told by my instructor that it didn't need to look like the example, only function the same, I decided I want my box to chill in the center of the page. Having it to the side like the example makes me want to add a transparent picture down in the right corner, as that was the format of many of my tumblr layouts. It's fun, but this is for a portfolio. Nice and centered just feels like the way to go.
After much research on the bootstrap site, I also figured out how to add a sticky footer! 

### Commit 7: Index Layout finished
I finished the basic layout for the index page and added some personal touches such as colors, rounding the image, and a background.
